# Pilsbot ROS2 Workspace

This repository contains a preconfigured workspace for development of the Pilsbot platform. The branch `foxy` includes all needed packages for desktop development and simulation. The branch `foxy-jetson` contains everything needed on the real hardware platform. Hence, it slightly differs from the main branch, since the custom build does currently not include any binary packages. 

In the future this might be fused into one branch, but this is currently not possible because the Jetson Nano officially doesn't support anything newer than Ubuntu 18.04.

## How to use this workspace

### Prerequisites

You should already have Docker and VSCode with the remote containers plugin installed on your system.

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [vscode remote containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Open it in vscode

Clone the repository to a folder of your choice with

```
git clone https://github.com/pilsbot/pilsbot_vscode_ws.git
```

or via ssh

```
git clone git@github.com:pilsbot/pilsbot_vscode_ws.git
```

Now that you've cloned your repo onto your computer, you can open it in VSCode (File->Open Folder). 

When you open it for the first time, you should see a little popup that asks you if you would like to open it in a container.  Say yes!

If you don't see the pop-up, click on the little green square in the bottom left corner, which should bring up the container dialog

In the dialog, select "Remote Containers: Reopen in container"

VSCode will build the dockerfile inside of `.devcontainer` for you.  If you open a terminal inside VSCode (Terminal->New Terminal), you should see that your username has been changed to `ros`, and the bottom left green corner should say "Dev Container"

2. Install dependencies `Terminal->Run Task..->install dependencies`
3. Run the build task with `Ctrl+Shift+B`

### Launch the simulation

To test a successfull configuarion and build of the workspace you can start the Pilsbot
simulation. You have to options to do so.

1. Open a terminal in your workspace and type: `ros2 launch pilsbot_simulation pilsbot.launch.py`
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` search for `ROS: Run a ROS launch file (roslaunch)`, type the package name `pilsbot_simulation`, choose a launch file e.g. `pilsbot.launch.py` and press `Enter` again to skip defining additional launch arguments.

Congratulations, you now have a setup workspace to develop on the Pilsbot platform! ðŸŽ‰

If any issues occur during the setup process, do not hesitate to open an issue, so we can
fix the problem as soon as possible.

## Good to know

- all packages added to the workspace should use `https`. If you have a Github account logged in your VSCode installation, you can easily push without the need for password authentication. You will be asked to acknowledge your login once via your browser and you're good to go.
